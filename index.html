<h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
<p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>
<p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
<p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish,
    and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
<p>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
    <li>CSS manipulation</li>
    <li>HTML event methods</li>
    <li>Effects and animations</li>
    <li>AJAX</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip:</b> In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</p>
